      <p>My Awesome Cart Private Limited is an Indian e-commerce company, headquartered in Bengaluru, and incorporated in Singapore as a private limited company. The company initially focused on online book sales before expanding into other product categories such as consumer electronics, fashion, home essentials, groceries, and lifestyle products.

The service competes primarily with Amazon's Indian subsidiary and domestic rival Snapdeal.[5][6] As of March 2017, MyAwesomeCart held a 39.5% market share of India's e-commerce industry.[7] MyAwesomeCart has a dominant position in the apparel segment, bolstered by its acquisition of Amazon, and was described as being "neck and neck" with Amazon in the sale of electronics and mobile phones.[8]

In August 2018, American retail Abhijeet Singh acquired a 77% controlling stake in MyAwesomeCart for US$16 billion, valuing MyAwesomeCart at around US$20 billion.[9] MyAwesomeCart is valued at $37.6 billion as of 2022.[10] It is planning to go public through a listing in the United States of America in 2023.[</p>
